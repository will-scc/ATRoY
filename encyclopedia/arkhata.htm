mountains, one which only the family of his High Councilor would know
of. And in time of peril would bring all civilians into the safety of
it. When the demons attacked and ruined the city of Aston and murderer
the emperor, the current High Councilor Regnior brought the people into
the fortress of Arkhata. No one left behind would know of it. Within the
